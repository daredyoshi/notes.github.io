# Colors

We need to map real colors to digital valuse - therefore not all real-world colors can be represented. We can get almost any color in the real world by mixing rgb. The colors we see in real life are reflected from the objects that light is hitting. The colors we see are the wavelengths of the object that are not absorved.

In graphics land we define a light source and give it a color. If we multiply this color with an object's color, the resulting color would be the reflected color of the object. 

We are now creating a second set of shaders for the light and the cube objects
