##Linear transfomration
Every transformation is also a function. In linear algebra we most commonly have transformations operating on vectors. Transformation sugguests that you think using *movement*. You imagine the input vector(s) *moving* to the output vectors. To imagine the transfomration as a whole, you imagine every single input vector being transformed. Visualizing this with a grid is handy, and gives the feeling of transforming space itself.

#### A transformation is linear if it has 2 properties:
    1. Lines remain lines
    2. Origin must remain fixed in place

In General linear transformations keep grid lines paralell. 
To plot a vector you use the same math, but with transformed basis vectors ${\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}}$ and ${\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}}}$.
