#Vectors, what even are they?

##There are three different perspectives on vectors
1. Physics Student
    Vectors are arrows in space. You can move it all around and it's still the same vector. Vectors in flat planes are 2d, and 3d ones are in space.
    
2. Mathematician
    A vector can be anything. Very abstract. Good to ignore for now. 

3. CS Student
    Vectors are lists of numbers. You use them for graph theory. Just a fancy word for list. 


We are going to thing of vectors as an arrow that always starts at the origin. In linear algebra the vector is always located at the origin. 

While we are all familiar with this coordinate system. We will go over it again anyway. The origin is the intersection of the axis. 

The coordinates of a vector is the numbers that determine it in each axis. They are usually resolved in the order of the axes. Ever pair of numbers only gives you one vector. 

## Vector Addition
To all 2 vectors, move the second one so that :starts at the tip of the first one. This type of addition is the only case in linear algebra where we concipate vectors away from the origin. This is the same as the sum of each number in each of the vectors.

It's like taking all of the steps of each vector manually. 1x+2x+4y+5y

## Vector Multiplication
Multiplying a vector by single number is called *scaling* vectors. You are multiplying each of the vectors' components by that number. 

## Conclusion
No matter which way you use you're always doing the same thing.
