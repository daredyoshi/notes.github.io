# Benchmarking

You can use renderDoc to benchmark your open gl stuff. Before at the top of the python program he did an import and inject. You can just use launch application to benchmark shit. 

Then you can capture a screen, and inspect everything from that frame. 

You can go through the whole pipeline. 

See all the shader buffer objects, all the structs etc. 

You can step through everything, and see how long everything took. 


# The order of things


Gl 4.6 it's simpler. 

Bind things after using the program in general.
