# Vectors

## Basis vectors ${\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}}$ and ${\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}}}$ 
These are the coordinate vectors by which a vector may be multiplied to be transformed into their coordinate space. 

The **span** of two vectors is the entirety of possible vectors in a coordinate space.

## Transforming a vector by a matrix
This goes over exactly how it happens that a vector is transformed by a matrix (think of matrix as a function) [Linear Transformations and Matrices](../Essence_of_linear_algebra/003_Linear_transformations_and_matrices)

# Dot product
The dot project projects two vectors onto the number line. If it's positive they are pointing similar directions, 0 if they are perpendicular and negative if they are pointing away from each other. It's the same as making a 1 row matrix out of the first vector and treating it as a transform. Read more [here](../Essence_of_linear_algebra/009_Dot_products_and_duality)
