# Vectors

## Basis vectors ${\mathbf{\hat{\imath}}}$ and ${\mathbf{\hat{\jmath}}}$ 
These are the coordinate vectors by which a vector may be multiplied to be transformed into their coordinate space. 

The **span** of two vectors is the entirety of possible vectors in a coordinate space.

## Transforming a vector by a matrix
This goes over exactly how it happens that a vector is transformed by a matrix (think of matrix as a function) [Linear Transformations and Matrices](../Essence_of_linear_algebra/003_Linear_transformations_and_matrices.md)
