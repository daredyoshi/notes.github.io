# Matrix Fundamentals

## Basic theory and multiplication 
You can read about how to transform a vector by a matrix in [Linar Transformations and Matrices](../Essence_of_linear_algebra/003_Linear_transformations_and_matrices)

This goes over th exact process of multiplying matricies [Matrix multiplication as composition](../Essence_of_linear_algebra/004_Matrix_multiplication_as_composition)

Multiplying 3d vectors written out [Three-dimensional linear transformations](../Essence_of_linear_algebra/005_Three-dimensional_linear_transformations)

The determinant of the matrix is the volume/area that it's basis vectors take up. Read more on how this works [here](../Essence_of_linear_algebra/006_The_determinant)
