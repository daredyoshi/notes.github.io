# Introduction

There is a lot more to learn in the C++11 and 14 than "more cpp". The advice that this book gives is not a set of water-tight rules, but principles which will help to use cpp more effecitvely.

One of the most pervasive new features of C++ 11 is the distinction between expressions that are **rvalues** from those that are **lvalues**. Rvalues are distinguished from lvlues from the fact that you can't take their address. They are temporary objects return from functions, while lvalues are stored in variables that are accessed either by pointer, name or reference.

Lot of info about notation type.
