These are notes from going through the learning on [this site](www.learncpp.com)

They are not comprehensive, but purely based on what I found useful.

## Introduction to Programming languages
Assembly translates machine code for the hardware. C++ is designed to be hardware agnostic - thus considered a high-level language. 

    Assembly: mov al, 061h
    C++: a = 97

The process of translating high level code into runtime code is either compiling or interpreting. **Compilers** read source code and generate executables that can then be run. **Interpreters** directly execute instructions in the source code without requiring a compilation stage. They are generally less efficient.
